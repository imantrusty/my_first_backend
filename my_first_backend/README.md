# Welcome to My First Backend
***

## Task
Problem: create a backend app with light web framework. The challenge here is to create a line of code that randomly chooses a Frank Sinatra song, a list of his wives, and whether the person logging in is authenticated to log in.

## Description
I solved the problem by creating an array and function that will call the list of wives, songs, and birth date. I also worked with my peer, Priscilla, to create a line of code that would state whether a particular person is authentcated or not to access the app.

## Installation
You will download the file through gitea with wget. 

## Usage
App will prompt user to log in. If user is authorized to sign in, text will say "Welcome, authentcated client". If not, text will say "Not authoried".
